Student Schedule app for WGU Andorid Dev Project
* Create an Android mobile application, compatible for Android 8.0 and higher. The application must include the following functional requirements:
  * Create a user option to enter term titles (e.g., Term 1, Term 2, Spring Term), start dates, and end dates for each term.
  * Create features that allow the user to add as many terms as needed.
  * Implement validation so that a term cannot be deleted if courses are assigned to it.
  * Create features that allow the user to do the following for each term:
    * Add as many courses as needed
    * Display a list of courses associated with each term
    * Display a detailed view of the term title (e.g., Term 1, Term 2, Spring Term), the start date, and the end date for each term
  * Include the following details for each course:
    * The course title
    * The start date
    * The end date
    * The status (in progress, completed, dropped, plan to take)
    * The course instructors’ names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses 
  * Include features that allow the user to do the following for each course:
    * Add as many assessments as needed.
    * Add a minimum of one optional note per course.
    * Enter, edit, and delete course information.
    * Display optional notes.
    * Display a detailed view of the course, including the end date.
    * Set alerts for the start and end date, that will trigger when the application is not running.
    * Share notes via a sharing feature (either e-mail or SMS) that automatically populates with the notes.
  * Include features that allow the user to do the following for each assessment:
    * Add performance and objective assessments for each course, including the titles and end dates of the assessments.
    * Enter, edit, and delete assessment information.
    * Set alerts for start and end dates, that will trigger when the application is not running.
* Design the following screen layouts, including appropriate GUI (graphical user interface) elements (e.g., navigation, input, and information) for each layout:
  * home screen
  * list of terms
  * list of courses
  * list of assessments
  * detailed course view
  * detailed term view
  * detailed assessment view
* Implement a scheduler within your application from Part A and include the following elements:
  * an ArrayList
  * an intent
  * navigation capability between multiple screens using activity
  * three activities
  * events (e.g., a click event)
  * the ability to work in portrait and landscape layout
  * interactive capability (e.g., the ability to accept and act upon user input)
  * a database to store and retrieve application data
  * an application title and an icon
  * notifications or alerts
  * the use of both declarative and programmatic methods to create a user interface
* Include the following interface requirements in the application from part C:
  * the ability to scroll vertically
  * an action bar
  * two layouts
  * input controls
  * buttons
* Create a storyboard to demonstrate application flow that includes each of the menus and screens from part B.
* Provide screen shots of generating the signed APK to demonstrate that you have created a deployment package.
 
**Note: Verify that all the required functions of your application are working by executing the apk file.**
 
* Reflect on the creation of your mobile application by doing the following:
  * Explain how your application would be different if it were developed for a tablet rather than a phone, including a discussion of fragments and layouts.
  * Identify the minimum and target operating system your application was developed under and is compatible with.
  * Describe (suggested length of 1–2 paragraphs) the challenges you faced during the development of the mobile application.
  * Describe (suggested length of 1–2 paragraphs) how you overcame each challenge discussed in part F3.
  * Discuss (suggested length of 1–2 paragraphs) what you would do differently if you did the project again.
  * Describe how emulators are used and the pros and cons of using an emulator versus using a development device.
* Acknowledge sources, using APA-formatted in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.
* Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
